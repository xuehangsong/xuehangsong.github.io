Hello, this is Xuehang, an Earth Scientist at [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://hydrology.pnnl.gov/) in the desert of southeastern Washington State. I received my bachelor and  PhD degree in Hydrology & Water Resources Engineering from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn), China. After spending one year as a postdoc in the Department of Scientific Computing at [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu/), I joined PNNL as a postdoc and later a staff scientist. You can find my CV [here](/files/cv.pdf).  
## Research Interests ##
<!-- Subsurface is one of the most understudied part in Earth system -->
Most of my research work focus on developing our understanding of biogeochemical reactions, energy, and mass transfer in subsurface system. I am especially interested in novel model and data integration methods to improve subsurface characterization, from which we will be able to predict, assess and ultimately design and operate environmental processes. Examples of my previous and onging research topics are:  
- Quantify long-term groundwater recharge in the [North China Plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_China_Plain) (Wuhan University)
- Develop data assimilation methods to improve saturated-unsaturated flow modeling (Wuhan University)
- Develop Bayesian inversion methods for delineating facies distribution using data assimilation and indicator geostatistics (Florida State University)
- How dam operations control temperature dynamics and biogeochemical fluxes in the [river corridor aquifer](https://sbrsfa.pnnl.gov/) (PNNL)
- How river bathymetry, riverbed sediments, subsurface geological units, river stage fluctuations, channel morphology impact the residence time, biogeochemical reactions of hydrologic exchange flows between the river and river corridor aquifer (PNNL)
- Support on decision making on nuclear waste treatment in [Hanford Site](https://www.hanford.gov/) (PNNL)
- Advanced geophysical imaging and inversion methods (PNNL)

## Specializations ##
- Groundwater flow and transport modeling  
- High-performance computing  
- Data assimilation and inverse modeling  
- Geostatistics

<!-- ## Areas I ## -->
<!-- - Geophysical inversion -->
<!-- - Reactive transport modeling -->

<!-- Since joining PNNL in 2015, he developed reactive transport models and particle tracking algorithms to study interactions between surface water and groundwater, integrated Bayesian data assimilation techniques and geostatistics tools to characterize heterogeneous aquifer properties in the Hanford 300 Area, and evaluated containments transport in DOE Hanford site with field data and numerical simulations. Dr. Song aims to advance the studies of hyporheic zone hydrological, thermal and biogeochemical processes through multi-scale models and data integration approaches. -->


<!-- For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory). -->

<!-- **Markdown generator** -->

<!-- I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator -->
<!-- ) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository. -->

<!-- How to edit your site's GitHub repository -->
<!-- ------ -->
<!-- Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.  -->
